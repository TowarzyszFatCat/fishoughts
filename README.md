<div align="center">
A normal game like any other, nothing special, but if you have something on your conscience... The game is intended to make you realize how much time are you wasting, how much time you can devote to the game... It contains many philosophical threads and author's thoughts. The mechanics are simple and tedious to quickly bore you and encourage you to turn it off. But if you reach the end... Then you can get a lot from it and answer YOUR difficult questions. 

  <br>
  
In this game you catch fishes that are representing difficult questions, philosophical threads and thoughts. There are over 100 different ones in it! Sometimes other characters, placed in the Void with you will talk to you. Everyone in the Void is led by the Void Master, but all power still belongs to the CREATOR.
